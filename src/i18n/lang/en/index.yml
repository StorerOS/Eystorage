  buildM1: 1.Storing data takes up a lot of disk space, which causes us to spend a lot of time thinking about whether the data is worth storing when we store files.
  buildM2: 2.At the same time, damaged disks are difficult to repair, and it costs a lot of money to repair. Recovery does not guarantee that data is not lost.
  buildM3: 3.If you use a centralized product to store data, your data security will not be guaranteed when network or hardware problems occur with the centralized service provider.
  buildM4: 1.Eystorage has a huge storage space, enough to record ever minute of your life.
  buildM5: 2.Eystorage uses IPFS, a distributed storage protocol that allows you to download your stored data over the network even if the central server is withdrawn.
